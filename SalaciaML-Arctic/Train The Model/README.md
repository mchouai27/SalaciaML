# Train The Model

This folder contains code to train a machine learning model for predicting data quality based on oceanographic features.

## Overview

The machine learning model in this folder is designed to identify and flag problematic data points in oceanographic datasets. It uses features such as temperature, salinity, depth, and pressure measurements to make predictions.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Dependencies section below).
2. Open and run the provided Python script `train_model.py`.
3. Follow the instructions within the script to load your dataset and train the model.
4. After training, the script will save the trained model in the folder.

## Script Details

- `train_model.py`: This script loads the dataset, preprocesses it, splits it into training and validation sets, trains the machine learning model, and saves the trained model.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
