# SalaciaML
# Oceanographic Data Processing and Quality Control

This repository contains three folders for processing and quality control of oceanographic data:

## All in One

This folder contains a Python script that processes oceanographic data, performs quality control checks, and predicts data quality using a machine learning model. The script takes input data in CSV format, processes it, checks for various data quality issues, and provides predictions for problematic data points.

## Traditional QC

This folder contains a Python script that provides functions to perform traditional quality control on oceanographic data, including temperature, salinity, depth, and pressure measurements. It detects various types of outliers and flags them accordingly.

## Train The Model

This folder contains code to train a machine learning model for predicting data quality. You can use it to train your own model.

### Usage

Each folder contains its own README.md file with instructions on how to use the scripts and train the model.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run the scripts:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
